      			Statement : Disability justice is at the root of all other social and political justice movements. Discrimination against a community begins with isolating them, othering them, and this typically takes the form of actions to imply that they are disabled. When we make disability inclusion the standard for human interactions, we take the wind out of the sails for so many other shapes stigma can take and help to protect other communities. Eliminating stigma and promoting inclusion and acceptance are core values and core actions for making life better for everyone. Ways to do this begin and center around being visible and creating opportunities for empathy and social bonding.  To do this, we also have create and protect safe spaces for disabled individuals and communities, both in the physical world as well as in online and virtual spaces. Safety needs to be provided and protected for the body, mind, and spirit.  These are aspirational goals, and I recognize that they can never be completely achieved, but I believe we have to keep trying.

      			Statement : As a person who has a disability, I feel that it is important to be a service to the disability constituency.  Although most of my professional work is not disability centric, I always dedicate a portion of my time to serving the disability constituency.  I could not be where I am today if others had not paved the way for me and it is critical for me to use the privileges I have to enable others to travel their own roads, as I did.  Of course, because of the work I do for the University, there is ample opportunity for me to support the disability constituency, facilitate access, remove barriers, and promote awareness about disability issues and culture as part of my job.

      			Statement : In college I had a medical condition that precluded me from taking a required course. Even with lab results, a physician’s note and the backing of the Campus Disability Office, I encountered road blocks toward completion of this requirement. The staunch administration and distrust of students I experienced has formed my conviction to accommodate Rackham guests in any way that I can so that their education and work is not interrupted.

      			School : School of Social Work<br>
      			Statement : I work with disability organizations to help recommend how community initiatives can empower PwD, and how institutions and local and state policy  are constructed without PWD in mind - and need to be reformed for their full inclusion. My work also focuses on how the intersection of multiple marginalized identities compounds barriers people with disabilities face, and how we are socialized to see disability as a "deficit," rather than a normal part of human diversity.

      			Department or Program : Communication and Media<br>
      			School : College of Literature, Science, & the Arts (LSA)<br>
      			Statement : Much of what we conceptualize as problematic child media "addiction" is actually media use in the service of sensory regulation in an increasingly dysregulating built environment. My work is aimed at helping parents understand that their child's sensory needs are different from their own, and that children's (and adults') behavior need not be framed as "problematic" once its gratifications are understood. Inclusion involves understanding how built and other social environments accommodate some people more than others. Since sensory regulation must occur before learning can happen, inclusivity means recognizing and supporting the unique sensory-regulation needs of all learners.

      			Statement : I do work to support and promote equitable access to information in the digital age. The work in this area can take many forms, but I primarily focus on fostering the publishing industry's continued transition to creating born-accessible books by acting locally -- making changes to Michigan Publishing's scholarly book publishing processes that incorporate digital accessibility into the authoring, editing, and production of books. I believe the most effective way to foster this change among peer scholarly presses is to lead with examples, collaboration, and education.

Accessibility in LGBTQ+ spaces - social, physical, and online - is a very important topic and area of work that can easily be drowned out by ableism and elitism within and outside of the community. I want to make sure my work at the Spectrum Center is flexible and useful for disabled folks so that everyone can access the resources we offer and put their own good into the world.

This has also given me a broader perspective on the limitations and barriers individuals with health conditions face in society. For these reasons, I am motivated to continually work toward universal access for individuals in physical, social and cultural contexts.

      			School : College of Literature, Science, & the Arts (LSA)<br>
      			Statement : I am a long-time disability advocate due to my personal experience with disabilities and my relationships with many other people with disabilities.  I taught for more than a dozen years and encountered far too many students who mentioned faculty members asking that they drop their class or failing to provide needed accommodations.  After hearing these stories, I completed research on faculty perspectives on working with students with disabilities, and the results of that research prompted me to create faculty workshops to help raise awareness and provide opportunities for faculty to learn about inclusive teaching.  I also completed a graduate certificate in Disability Studies through CUNY, which included course work on disability law and the sociopolitical history of disabilities in the United States.  I am that person who is always thinking about who is being left out in various spaces and what barriers people are encountering to full participation, and I aim to be part of the solution for reducing and removing those barriers.

      			School : School of Social Work<br>
      			Statement : I have personal and professional motivations for this work. I believe all people deserve the opportunity to attend higher education. The barriers that are in the way can often be daunting. The idea that I could work on a project that helped to make access and inclusion less difficult for all students had been incredible. Including students who may not qualify under the laws as they are now. I have a child who suffers from an autoimmune condition and has severe chronic pain. Even with accommodations, it can be difficult for her to attend an entire school day.  There are many things that could have been easy done, just as part of the schools everyday, that would have made a huge impact on their learning.

      			Statement : I am motivated by my understanding that all people have inherent value and are an asset to society. All people have a right to dignity, respect, equity, and all the basic rights within the society of which they are a part. Disability is the largest minority of individuals in the world and appropriate support should reflect their fundamental and essential inclusion. There are enough resources to make certain that this understand and necessary resources exist to uphold disabled individuals as equal community members. .
